# Genki Chapter 1
## Expression notes
*おはよう*/*ありがとう*　
* These are used with ございます to be polite.

*さようなら*
* Not used very often. You use it as a formal goodbye when you're not expecting to see the person again for a long time. 
* Could use じゃあ、また　between friends expecting to see each other again soon
* Or, しつれいします　as a less casual goodbye, but implying that you will still see them again soon.

*すみません*
* "excuse me" to get someones attention
* "I'm sorry" to apologize
* "thank you" to show appreciation for something somebody has done for you

*いいえ*
* Primarily just means "no"
* can also be used to mean "don't mention it" or "you're welcome"

*いってらっしゃい / いってきます*
* A common exchange when someone is leaving the house.

*だだいま/おかえり*
* A common exchange when someone is coming home.

## Grammar
### XはYです
* Think of です　As a way of saying "it is"
* は　Is the subject marking particle.
* It is very common to leave out the topic (and therefore は) if it is clear from context what the subject is.

#### Examples
* じゅうにじはん*です*　（It） is half past twelve.
* がくせい*です*　（I） am a student
* にほんご*です*　（My major) is the Japanese language

When it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is then we can use は to  mark the topic.

#### Examples
せんこう*は*にほんご*です*　（My）Major is the japanese language

Similar to this, you can use this pattern to identify a thing X as something else Y.

#### Examples
* わたし*は*ブレント*です*　I am Brent
* やましたさん*は*せんせい*です*　Mr.Yamashita is a teacher
* ジェシカ*は*カナダじん*です*　Jessica is a Canadian

は is a particle, these attach themselves to phrases and indicate how those phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

*Note*: that in Japanese that　がくせい  (for example) stands alone. Where in English we might say "a student". Similarly there is no item that corresponds to a plural.  So がくせいです can mean "we are/you are/they are students" or "I am/you are/she is a student"

### Question Sentences
Basically all you need to do to form a question is to add か at the end of a statement.

#### Example
* りゅがくせいです　becomes 　りゅがくせいです*か*　changing the meaning from "I am an international student." to "Are you an international student?"

The above example is a yes/no question. Question sentences can also contain "question words" like なん(what).  なん can also be pronounced なに
* なん is used immediately before です or before a "counter" like じ. なに is used before particles and in the combination なにじん

#### Examples
* いま*なん*じですか  - "What time is it now?"
* ジェシカさんは*なん*さいですか　- "How old are you Jessica?"
* *なん*せいですか　- "What year are you in college?"
* でんわばんごうは*なん*ですか　- "What is your telephone number?"

### Noun の　Noun
の is a particle that connects two nouns. さくらだいがくのがくさい　means "a student at Sakura university" . The second noun がくせい is  the main idea and the noun that comes first さくらだいがく makes the other noun more specific. It can also act as a possessive and in a few other ways.

#### Examples
* たけしさんは*の*でんわばんごう　Takeshi's phone number.
* だいがく*の*せんせい　A university professor
* にほんご*の*がくせい　A student of the japanese language
* にほん*の*だいがく　A university in Japan

Unlike English, Japanese is more consistent with where the subject of the sentence should be placed. The main subject also comes after the description that is placed before it.

A phrase of the form Noun のNoun acts more or less like one big now, you could put it anywhere you'd normally be able to put a single now.

#### Example
*たけしさんのおかあさん*は*こうこうのせんせい*です　- meaning "*Takeshi's mother* is a *high school teacher.*"

## Expression Notes
*あの*
This is basically the same as 'um..." you can use it to fill space, or show reservation in what you're about to say.

*はい　Or ええ*
These both mean "yes" in response to a yes-no question. ええ is more informal. You can also use はい as a response to a knock at the door or when someone calls your name.

*そうですか*
Acknowledges that you have understood what was just said. "Is that so?" or "I see."

*Pronounciation of は*
Whenever used as a particle は is pronounced "wa", this is also the case for こんにちは　or こんぼんは. Otherwise the "wa" sound is written わ

*Numbers*
Many number words have more than one pronounciation.
0. ゼロ　and れい　are both commonly used.
1. いち but pronounced as いっ in いっぷん(one minute) and いっさい (one year old)
2. に all the time, when you are reading out each digit separately it may be pronounced with a long vowel にい
3. さん　All the time。The part that follows may change shape, giving さんぷん　Instead of さんふん
4. よん　is the most basic, but fourthーyear student is よねんせい　And four o'clock is よじ。In some combinations that we will learn later it is read し　as in しがつ　（April)。The part that follow this number may change shape to, such as よんぷん
5. ご　All the time. When reading each digit seperately the vowel can be extended ごう
6. ろく But pronounced ろっ In ろっぷん
7. なな　is the most basic, but seven o clock is しちじ
8. はち、But usually pronounced はっ　In はっぷん　And はっさい
9. きゅう　Is most basic but nine o clock is くじ
10. じゅう　Is most basic, but pronounced じゅっ　Or  じっ　In じゅっぷん/じっぷん　And じゅっさい/じっさい

*Giving a telephone number*
* The particle の is usually placed between the local exchange code and the last four digits. So 012-345-6789 is said ゼロ　いち　に　さん　よん　ご　の　ろく　なな　はち　きゅう

*せんせい*
This is usually used for describing someone else's occupation. It technically means "honorable master" so it can sound arrogant if you refer to yourself. If you want to be modest you can use きょうし

*さん*
This is placed after a name as a generic title. If goes with both a given name and a family name. Children are usually referred to as ちゃん　(and boys in particular as くん）。Professors and doctors usually are referred to with せんせい

*Referring to the person you are talking to*
The word for you あなた is not very commonly used. Instead we use the name in the title to refer to the person that we are talking to.
