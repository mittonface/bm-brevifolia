## Verb Conjugation
Verbs in Japanese conjugate, or take various shapes.  We will learn three forms
1. The "dictionary forms"
2. The present tense affirmative forms
3. The present tense negative forms

There are two kinds of verbs that follow regular conjugation patterns, here is an example of each

```
                         ru-verb           u-verb
verb bases               tabe              ik
dictionary forms         食べる(to eat)     行く（To go)
present, affirmative　　　食べます　　　　　　　行きます
present, negative        食べません　　　　　　行きません
stems                    食べ　　　　　　　　　行き　　
```

食べる belongs to the group of verbs called the "ru-verbs". They are called this because you add the suffix 'ru' to the verb base to form the dictionary form. For the two long forms you simply add the suffixes masu and masen instead of ru to the bases.  Four ru verbs that we will learn right now

食べる（たべる）　寝る（ねる）　起きる（おきる）　見る（みる）
食べます　　　　　寝ます　　　　起きます　　　　　見ます

Another major group of verbs is called the "u-verbs". The dictionary form of an u-verb can be broken down into the base and the suffix 'u'. The long forms then are formed with the base plus imasu and imasen.

We will look at six u-verbs right now

飲む（のむ）　読む（よむ）　話す（はなす）　聞く（きく）　行く（いく）　帰る（かえる）
呑みます　　　読みます　　　話します　　　　聞きます　　　行きます　　　帰ります

All ru-verbs end in ru while u-verbs can end in a number of u-vowel sounds, include ru. Therefor if a verb does not end in ru it will always be a u verb. For verbs ending in ru if the vowel sound preceding the ru is an /a/ /u/ /o/ sound it wall always be a u-verb. Otherwise if the sound is /i/ or /e/ it will _most likely_ be ru-verb.

There are two irregular verbs (that are neither ru or u verbs). Note that the vowels in their bases are different in the short forms and the long form.

```
                         ru-verb           u-verb
dictionary forms         suru(to eat)      kuru（To go)
present, affirmative　　　shimasu　　　　　　 kimasu
present, negative        shimasen　　　　　　kimasen
stems                    shi　　　　　　　　  ki　　
```

These two verbs are also used to form compound verbs. In this lesson we learn the verb benkyou which conjugates just like suru.

It is important to remember which verbs belong to which conjugation class. It is a good idea to memorize each verb as a set. Instead of just dictionary form try to remember the dictionary form and the present tense affirmative form.  This is especially important with verbs that end with る because they may be irregular verbs, u-verbs or ru-verbs. 

## Verb types and present tense
In this lesson we learned about a dozen verbs that describe basic human action. These are often called "action verbs" and the "present tense" of these verbs means either
1. that a person habitually or regularly engages in these activities or 
2. that this person will, or is planning to perform these actions in the future.

*Habitual Actions*
私はよくテレビを見ます。I often watch TV
メアリーさんわときどき朝こはんを食べません　Mary sometimes doesn't eat breakfast

*Future Actions*
私はあしたきょとに行きます　I will go to Kyoto Tomorrow

## Particles
Nouns used in sentences generally must be followed by particles, which indicate the relations the nouns have to the verbs. In this lesson we learn 4 particles. を、で、に、へ

The particle を indicates "direct objects" the kind of things that are directly involved in, or affected by the event. Note that this particle is pronounced "o"

コーヒー*を*飲みます。　I drink coffee.
音楽*を*聞きます。I listen to music
テレビ*を*見ます　I watch TV.


The particle で indicates where the event described by the verb will take place.
図書館*で*本を読みます　I will read books in the library
うち*で*テレビを見ます　I will watch TV At home

The particle に has many meanings but here we will learn 2
1. The goal towards which things move
	1. 　私は今日学校に行きません　I will not got to school today
	2. 私はうちに帰ります。　I will not return home.
2. The time at which the event takes place
	1. 日曜日に京都に行きます　　I will go to kyoto on Sunday
	
Approx. time references can be made by substituting ごろ、ごろに、for に


The particle へ also indicates the goal of movement. So the above sentences can instead be written
私は今日学校へ行きません

## Time reference
You need the particle ni with (1) the days of the week like "on Sunday" and (2) with numerical time expressions like "at 10:45" and "in September".

日曜日に行きます　I will go on Sunday
十時四十五分に起きます I get up at 10:45

You do not use the particle ni with (1) time expressions relative to the present moment such as "today" and "tomorrow", (2) expressions describing regular intervals "every day" "every night" (3) the word for when

あしたきます。I will come tomorrow
毎晩テレビを見ます。I watch TV every evening
いつ行きますか。　When will you go?

You normal doo not use に with 1) parts of the day like "in the morning" and "at night" 2) the word weekend. Unlike words like あした　And 毎晩 above. However these words can be followed by ni depending on styles emphases and personal preference.

朝（に）新番を読みます。　I read the newspaper in the morning
週末（に）何をしますか。　What will you do on weekends?

## 〜ませんか
You can use ませんか (the present tense negative verb, plus the question particle) to extend an invitation. It should be noted that its affirmative counterpart, ますか、cannot be so used. Thus a sentence like 昼ご飯を食べますか　can only be construed as a question and not as an invitation.

昼ご飯を食べませんか。 What do you say to having lunch with me?
いいですね。　Sounds great.

テニスをしませんか。　Will you play tennis with me？
うーん、ちょっと　Um, it's slightly(inconvenient for me at this moment)

## Word Order
Japanese sentences are fairly flexible in the arrangement of elements that appear within them. Generally they are made up of several noun-particle sequences followed by a verb or an adjective, which in turn is often followed by a sentence-final particle such as 化、れ、よ。 Among the noun particle sentences their order are to a large extent free. A typical sentence thus often looks like the following but several other arrangements of noun-particle sentences are also possible.


私は　　今日　　図書館で　　日本語を　　勉強します。
topic       time       place                object            verb
I will study Japanese in the library today.

私は　　よく　　　    七時ごろ　　うちへ　　　帰ります。
topic       frequency 　 time                goal               verb
I often go back home at around seven.　
 
## Frequency adverbs
You can add frequency adverbs such as 毎日（Everyday)、よく（Often）、ときどき（Sometimes)　to a sentence to describe how often you do something

私はときどき喫茶店に行きます　I sometimes go to a coffee shop

In this lesson we also learn two adverbs that describe how infrequency an activity is;　ぜんぜん（Never;not at all）、These adverbs anticipate the negative at the end of the sentence. In other words, if you use them you must end your sentence with ません

私はぜんぜんテレビを見ません　I do not watch TV ever
たけしさんはあまり勉強しません　Takeshi does not study much

## The Topic particle は
As we know, the topic marking particle presents the topic of one sentence. It puts forward the item that you want to talk about and comment on. A topic phrase, however, need not be the subject of a sentence. We see sentences where non subject phrases are made topics with the help of this particle.

メアリーさん、*週末は*たいてい何をしまつか。Mary, what do you usually do on the weekend?
*今日は*京都に行きます。I'm going to kyoto today

In the above examples, the particle promotes time expressions as the topic of each sentence.  Its effects can be paraphrased like these "Let's talk about weekends, what do you do on weekends?", "Let me say what I will do today, I will go to Kyoto"

晩ご飯は？　食べません
How about dinner?     I will not eat

In this example, the particle is used in directing the listeners attention and thereby inviting a comment or completion of the sentence. You may also note that the broached topic does not stand in subject relation to the verb, but is rather its direct object.

## Expression Notes
行く／くる　When you move to the place that the hearer is, you say "I'm coming" in English. However in the same situation 私は行きます　is used in Japanese. 来る Is a movement toward the place where the speaker is、行く　Is a movement in a direction away from the speaker.

ちょっと Literally means "a little", "a bit", "a smalll amount" as in ちょっとください　"Please give me a little" and ちょっと待ってください "Please wait a moment." It is commonly used as a polite refusal. In such a case it means "inconvenient", "impossible".
Japanese people usually don't respond with No because it sounds too direct.

土曜日に映画をみませんか。　Will you see a movie this saturday?
土曜日は、ちょっと　Saturday is not convenient. (lite. Saturday, a little.)
